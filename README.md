### Hi, I'm Ricardo ðŸ‘‹

I'm an engineering manager at dashdash. I started my career in 2008 by developing (mostly) web applications. I've worked in several areas, particularly in education, banking and e-commerce area.

In the last years, Iâ€™ve been focused mainly on managing teams by acting as a mentor and a coach.

To me, the recipe for a great team is composed of 3 different ingredients with equal parts:
- Motivated people - core ingredient to success;
- Get things done - push things live as in itâ€™s better live than perfect;
- Great technical knowledge - pretty much self-explanatory.

I really love to ride my motorcycle and go out with my friends. If I can do both at the same time, the better.
