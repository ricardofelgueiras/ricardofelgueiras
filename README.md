<!-- I'm an engineering manager at dashdash. I started my career in 2008 by developing (mostly) web applications. I've worked in several areas, particularly in education, banking and e-commerce area.

In the last years, Iâ€™ve been focused mainly on managing teams by acting as a mentor and a coach.

I really love to ride my motorcycle and go out with my friends. If I can do both at the same time, the better.
